"Write a story about a Chinese-American student sitting in a university library. They are looking at a map of the Pacific in a geopolitical journal. The text describes a 'decoupling' that feels like it’s physically tearing their own identity in half. Focus on the silent weight of being a 'variable' in a global calculation."

                <i>Isn't there a line in the "Dream of Red Chamber" (the classical Chinese novel) that says something about truth and fiction being mixed up?</i>

You are thinking of one of the most famous couplets in Chinese literature, found in Chapter 5 of Dream of the Red Chamber (Hónglóu Mèng).

As the protagonist, Jia Baoyu, enters the "Land of Illusion," he sees this inscription on an archway:

                <i>假作真時真亦假，無為有處有還無。
                (Jiǎ zuò zhēn shí zhēn yì jiǎ, wú wéi yǒu chù yǒu hái wú.)</i>

The standard translation (by David Hawkes) captures it perfectly:

                <i>"Truth becomes fiction when the fiction's true; Real becomes not-real when the unreal's real."</i>

This couplet isn't just a literary observation; it is a logical framework for someone living in a "New Cold War" reality. It suggests that the boundary between what is "Official" (The Truth), and what is "Private/Fictional" (The Fake), is really kind of porous.

This line informs the philosophy of Local Loom Logic:

The Fictional Shield: By writing about "Ethan" or "Mei" (Fiction), you are actually recording the "True" emotional experience of the diaspora. Because the truth is too dangerous or taxing to say directly, the fiction becomes the only way for the truth to be "real."

The Institutional Facade: Conversely, the "Official Truth" (headlines, political rhetoric) often feels like a "Fiction." In 2026, for an nth-generation Millenial, Gen-Z, or emergent Gen-Alpha Chinese-American (or other hyphenated identity, although I have a personal bias), the "Real" world of policy is often less real to the individual than the "Unreal" world of their personal anxieties.

The Mosaic is woven of many threads.

                <i>This site was designed with the Chinese-American experience in mind as the primary example, but other identities are welcome to share their point of view. The US-China rift is one of the biggest currents in the world that has an impact on many different demographics.</i>

It was previously designed to download a lightweight LLM for local processing, but we changed the architecture for the site to become a node for sharing the Local Loom Logic philosophy.</a></i>

                <i>...Wait a second. Why are you doing this in the first place?</i>

In an era of seeming hyper-connection, it has become harder than ever to talk about the things that matter -- identity, pressure, the weight of the "Model Minority" script, and the silent "Cold War" we are expected to fight.

As <a href="https://www.committee100.org/media-center/national-survey-data-of-chinese-americans-shows-mental-health-and-discrimination-continue-to-be-key-concerns/" target="_blank">research from the Committee of 100 and Columbia University recently highlighted</a>, approximately 50% of Chinese Americans have reported feelings of hopelessness within the last 30 days.

Nearly three-quarters (72%) of Chinese-descent scientists in the U.S. do not feel safe as academic researchers <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10318999/" target="_blank">(PNAS)</a>.

This project is an experiment in creating a "Third Space" where it is possible to explore some of the deepest issues of our time.

For some people this may be overwhelming. If it sounds like too much for you, feel free to walk away. This is an entirely voluntary endeavor.

Note: This project was originally called "Mentor", but I realized it was not appropriate for me to position myself as a mentor figure and transitioned to a more "peer to peer" model, hence "Mosaic". The original "Mentor" physical flyer was bold, rigid and perhaps alarming, but the "Mosaic" one goes for a softer aesthetic in line with the community spirit.
